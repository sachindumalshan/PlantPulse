<h2>Project: PlantPulse - IoT Based Smart Agriculture System</h2>

![Plant Pulse](https://github.com/sachindumalshan/PlantPulse/assets/73152414/b5fce518-c585-476d-956e-caba7e5158cc)
PlantPulse is the result of my passion for home automation, combining cutting-edge technology and the power of the Internet of Things (IoT). This project is designed to make life smarter, more convenient, and safer for homeowners.

üß© Key Components:
- ESP32 Microcontroller Board
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Light Sensor
- DHT11 Sensor
- Mini Submersible Water Pump
- L293 Motor Driver IC
- 2 x 3.7V 18650mAh Batteries

üí° What Can PlantPulse Do?
- PlantPulse integrates all these elements to establish a seamless IoT-based smart agriculture system. Users can conveniently oversee and manage their farms from anywhere in the world, thanks to the constant internet connectivity. Utilizing the Arduino Cloud Platform, you can monitor sensor data through a web dashboard or a dedicated app.

üåæ Crop Moisture Management:
- The Soil Moisture Sensor keeps tabs on soil moisture levels, optimizing your plant care. Using soil moisture data, it checks the moisture level and automatically controls water flow to the crop accordingly, ensuring efficient irrigation.

üíß Water Resource Management:
- The Mini Submersible Water Pump, which can be controlled manually and also operates automatically, assists in efficient water resource management for your crops.

üå°Ô∏è Climate Monitoring:
- The DHT11 Sensor ensures you're aware of the temperature and humidity levels in your farm.

‚òÄÔ∏è Plant Illumination:
- You can monitor the sunlight levels for your plants using the app.

This project showcases the potential of IoT by enabling you to remain connected to your farm, regardless of your location. For more information: #link

Let's make our farms smarter, more secure, and highly efficient with PlantPulse! üå±


<h4><u>Step 1:</u></h4>
I crafted a rustic wooden farm prototype featuring plants, a water pipe system, a control room with a power supply, and a water tank equipped with a mini water pump. To build my system, I arranged these elements within the wooden structure, ensuring their proper placement and functionality.

<h4><u>Step 2:</u></h4>
Establishing a seamless connection between an ESP32 microcontroller and the Arduino Cloud Platform is an exciting project. By configuring variables within the Arduino Cloud, you can conveniently oversee and manage your ESP32 remotely via both a dedicated app and a web dashboard. Upload the code to your board using the Arduino Create Agent software to enable real-time data exchange. This combination of IoT technology offers not only functionality but also an elegant solution for monitoring temperature, humidity, and light levels and controlling the water pump.
